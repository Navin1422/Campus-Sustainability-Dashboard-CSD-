# Campus-Sustainability-Dashboard-CSD-
Overview
The Campus Sustainability Dashboard (CSD) is an interactive, gamified web platform designed to motivate and engage students in eco-friendly activities. It connects real-world sustainability efforts—like waste reduction, energy saving, and tree planting—with digital rewards, leaderboards, and real-time impact visualization.
By merging fun gameplay elements with data-driven insights, CSD aims to make sustainability a daily habit rather than a one-time event.
